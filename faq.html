        <summary>What is Spy.pet?</summary>
        Spy.pet operates as a Discord scraping service, where bots infiltrate
        public Discord servers to monitor various events like messages, bans,
        and voice chat activity. These gathered data are then marketed for
        personal or enterprise purposes, often without obtaining proper consent
        from the users involved.

        <summary>How to obtain a Discord Server ID?</summary>
        To obtain a Discord server ID, you need to activate Developer Mode in
        your Discord settings. Navigate to App Settings > Advanced, and toggle
        on 'Developer Mode.' Once enabled, select a server from your server
        list, and you'll find a 'Copy Server ID' button at the bottom.

        <summary>How does this service work?</summary>
        This website uses
        <a
          href="https://kickthespy.pet/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferer noopener"
          >kickthespy.pet</a
        >'s API, this means when you input server id we send it to
        kickthespy.pet and show response from API to you. Initially
        kickthespy.pet didn't had frontend with UI and cool buttons etc. that's
        why i've created this website.
